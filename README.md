# D3D-Hijacker

**Still Enjoy Custom Renderers in GTA V**

D3D-Hijacker is your gateway to using custom renderers in GTA V, such as [gta5_fsr](https://github.com/NarutoUA/gta5_fsr/).

## How to Use

You have two options for using D3D-Hijacker:

- **Use the Released DLL:** Simply download the pre-compiled DLL from the [Releases](https://github.com/alessandromrc/D3D-HIjacker/releases/) section of this repository.

- **Compile Your Own:** If you prefer to build it yourself, open the Visual Studio project provided and compile it.

Once you have the DLL ready, follow these steps to make it work in the game:

- Use an early injector capable of instantly injecting the DLL just after the game starts. We recommend [Stand Launchpad](https://github.com/calamity-inc/Stand-Launchpad) as a reliable solution for this purpose.

- Launch GTA V, and your custom renderer should seamlessly integrate with the game.

## Notes

D3D-Hijacker will automatically load [Reshade](https://reshade.me/) if it's found in the game files, enhancing your graphics experience.
